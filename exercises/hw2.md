# Making Things Move - Expressive Movement

You will create a simple servo plus dev board construction with a stationary base and a moving part. This could be a bar of soap that waves hello. It could be a flower that looks around from its pot. It could be a dog that wags its tail, or something more absurd. 

Your stationary base should hold the servo (so measure the base of your servo), and the moving part should attach to the servo horn. 

# Process

1. Sketch to come up with an idea for base and moving part. 
  - What will you animate? Is it an existing object you modify (for instance grafting an action figure arm onto a bar of soap)? Will you fabricate two parts (laser cut, 3d print)?
2. Gather your supplies. (servo, power supply, dev board, physical objects/"thing to be animated")
3. Get the simple servo examples working from in-class.
4. Find a good way to attach the objects to your servo.
5. Program a behavior for your design.
  - Upload your code frequently to the dev board to see how it looks. Iterate on your code.
6. Document and demonstrate.

# Documentation

1. Document your sketches and any plans/designs.
2. Photograph your parts and the final assembly. 
3. Record a video of your object in motion. 

# Submission
1. Canvas:
   - Arduino code as .zip file. 
   - Photo of your circuit.
   - Video documenting your "expressive movement" in action.
   - (use the naming convention _hw2_Lastname_1.zip_, _hw2_Lastname.jpg_ and _hw2_Lastname.mp4 for the files.)
2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - add all of the images, photos, diagrams, and links to the video to your sketchbook. Make sure video is playable by Jennifer and me!

DUE 1/20 (Tuesday) to Canvas.
