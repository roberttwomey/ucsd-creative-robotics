# Making Things Move

You will create a simple servo plus arduino construction with a stationary base and a moving part. It could be a box that waves hello. Your stationary base should hold the servo (so measure the base of your servo). The moving component should attach to one of the servo attachments. 

# Process

1. Sketch to come up with an idea for base and moving part. 
  - What will you animate? Is it an existing object you modify? Will you fabricate two parts (laser cut, 3d print)
2. Gather your supplies. (servo, power supply, arduino, physical objects/"thing to be animated")
3. Get the simple servo examples working from in-class.
4. Find a good way to attach the objects to your servo.
5. Program a behavior for your design.
  - Upload your code frequently to the arduino to see how it looks. Iterate on your code.
6. Document and demonstrate.

# Documentation

1. Document your sketches and any plans/designs.
2. Photograph your parts and the final assembly. 
3. Record a video of the object in motion. 

# Submission
1. Canvas:
   - Arduino code as .zip file. 
   - Photo of your circuit.
   - Video documenting your "signal" in action.
   - (use the naming convention _hw2_Lastname_1.zip_, _hw2_Lastname.jpg_ and _hw2_Lastname.mp4 for the files.)
2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - add all of the images, photos, diagrams, and links to the video to your sketchbook. Make sure video is playable by me!

DUE 10/16 (Wednesday) to [Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60624/assignments/865936)
