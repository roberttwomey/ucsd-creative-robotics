# Remote Control

Extend our in-class activities with the ESP32 Dev Board (TOI) using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to read and write from the device. Control some number of remote actuators using a p5 sketch. You could take your biomimicry project and rebuild it to use BLE instead of a serial connection. Or think of some other interesting behavior that could be triggered/controlled remotely.

# Process

Build on our in-class experiments with BLE. 

# Documentation

1. Document your sketches and any plans/designs.
2. Photograph your parts and the final assembly. 
3. Record a video of the object in motion. 

# Submission
1. Canvas:
   - Arduino code as .zip file. 
   - Photo of your circuit.
   - Video documenting your "signal" in action.
   - (use the naming convention _hw3_Lastname_1.zip_, _hw3_Lastname.jpg_ and _hw3_Lastname.mp4 for the files.)
2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - add all of the images, photos, diagrams, and links to the video to your sketchbook. Make sure video is playable by me!
3. Reflection: Add a minimum 5 sentence comment in the submission text box where you provide the following:
   - A description of your submission (what you tried to do) (1-2 sentences)
   - A personal reflection: use the elements of a SOAR note (4+ sentences)
   - How did today feel? How did you feel you did? (Subjective)
   - What did you actually do today? How long did it take? (Objective)
   - What do you need to focus on tomorrow, or next? (Action)
   - What did you learn from today's experience that you can take moving forward? (Reflection)

DUE 11/6 (Wednesday) to [Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60624/assignments/870599)
