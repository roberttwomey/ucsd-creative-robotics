## Description

This project asks you to engage with this rich intersection of feelings and machines (Human and Technological). 

The topics in this class have circled around questions of intelligence, responsiveness, expressiveness, meaningful behavior, and beliefs/feelings. What are the ways in which technologies can be seen to demonstrate these qualities? Or how do technologies engage with these qualities in our selves? It is about exploring reciprocal relationships between humans and machines?

For this project we want you to build an "Affective Machine". This could be a machine that demonstrates affect (outward expression of emotions), or acts upon us in an affective way (causing change in our emotions). You could approach this through ideas of (a) affective and social computing literature, (b) machine therapy, or even (c) healing machines.

This will require you to have a perspective: 
- What does it mean to have or demonstrate "feelings"?
- What does it mean to act on or upon "feelings"?
- How can a thing tend to our needs?
- How can we tend to a machine's needs? How can a machine ask for help?

## Requirements

You will be responsible for this as a complete sculpture. Use the envision board, some combination of sensors, actuators, displays, inputs/outputs. (BLE, laptop).

## Initial Ideation

For this assignment you are being asked to ideate and develop **three unique concepts** that explore the idea of Affective Machines. Exploring this intersection of feelings and machines, we are curious about machines the (a) act on feelings - changing them (ours/theirs), (b) express feelings - evoking them, or (c) are affected by feelings (ours/theirs/others).

Each concept reflects your take on a machine that evokes strong feeling or a strong feeling that is embodied in a machine. Each of your three concepts should be unique, thoughtfully considered, and demonstrate creative risk.

Document each concept in your digital sketchbook, include supporting sketches, imagery and text.

Minimum 1 page each (3 pages total), more is fine!

DUE Tuesday Week 7, submit pdf pages to canvas.

## Proposal
DUE End of Week 7

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the costume or prop prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach to the prompt. What is your project? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?
  - What is the perspective that you are taking on the questions above?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - What technical know-how will you need to make your piece? 
  - What do you need to learn how to do that you do not know how to do? 
  - What sensors/actuators will you use to make your piece? 
  - What fabrication techniques will you use? 
  - In what context does your project exist?
    - How will you document your project? 

This written description will be submitted online to Canvas by Friday 2/20 end of day.

## Deliverables

1. Machines + Feelings - 3 Concepts/Design Ideas
   - 3 pages of sketches, diagrams, and notes in your digital sketchbook (pdf)
2. Proposal: 
   - Written proposal submitted to Canvas and added to your digital sketchbook (pdf)
3. Final Project Submission:  
   - Add the following to your digital sketchbook and submit:
     - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
     - Images
     - Embedded Videos with links.
    - source code (as zip)
    - circuit diagrams
    - photographs and/video of finished piece. 
3. Critique: 
   - Be prepared to present your project for Critique in Week 10.
