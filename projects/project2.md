## Description

This project asks you to engage with this rich intersection of Feelings and and Machines (Human and Technological). 

The topics in this class have circled around questions of intelligence, responsiveness, meaningful behavior, and beliefs/feelings. What are the ways in which technologies can be seen to demonstrate these qualities? Or how do technologies engage with these qualities in our selves? It is about exploring reciprocal relationships between humans and machines.

To some extent this project is a choose your own adventure. I want you to navigate some path towards machines and feelings, whether it is (A) Affective Machinesa, (B) Healing machines, (C) Smart/Responsive Technologies.

This will require you to have a perspective: 
- What does it mean to be "smart"?
- When can a thing have feelings?
- How can a thing tend to our needs? Heal what ails us? 
- Can a machine have beliefs? 

## Requirements

I will require you to use the envision board (~sigh~) and the Arduino IDE/software. You can use the board as an arduino (it does not have to be networed), but I do want you to use it. 

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the costume or prop prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach to the prompt. What is your project? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?
  - What is the perspective that you are taking on the questions above?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - What technical know-how will you need to make your piece? 
  - What do you need to learn how to do that you do not know how to do? 
  - What sensors/actuators will you use to make your piece? 
  - What fabrication techniques will you use? 
  - In what context does your project exist?
    - How will you document your project? 

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/60624/assignments/863262) by Friday, November 22 end of day. 

## Deliverables

1. Proposal: 
   - Written proposal submitted to Canvas. 
2. Final Project Submission:  
   - Add the following to your digital sketchbook and submit:
     - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
     - Images
     - Embedded Videos with links.
    - source code (as zip)
    - circuit diagrams
    - photographs and/video of finished piece.
