# Description

In this hands-on seminar we will explore the connection between art and engineering. We will apply the fundamental topics and skills covered in this seminar to create interactive robotic avatars. Topics include the development of expressive behavior through visual design and mechanical motion, character design and fabrication, and the use of a microcontroller, sensors and actuators. We will use a design process to guide the avatar development from a concept to a functional robotic sculpture.

# Grading

## Graded activities
[TK Subject to Revision]
- 40% Exercises – approximately 8 weekly exercises
- 45% Projects – 3 total at approximately 15% each
- 10% Digital Sketchbook - cumulative
- 5% Participation

Work will be evaluated on the quality of concept, the degree of experimentation (both aesthetic and technical), and final realization (again, aesthetic and technical). Prompts and rubrics will be provided with more specific details regarding each assignment and breakdowns

## Description of Assignments and Exams

__*Exercises*__
[TK]
<!--
We will have regular, weekly assignments employing the tools and techniques covered in class. These will be short activities with clearly stated creative prompts and technical requirements. Projects will be graded on satisfactory completion with additional credit for creative, technical, expressive extension beyond requirements. -->

__*Projects*__
[TK]
<!--We will have two projects over the semester due approximately midterm and final. Project 1 covers digital fabrication and analog and computer mediated processes. Project 2 covers wearables and embodied technologies. For each project students will submit a project archive containing a statement of concept, 3d models, documentation of the work, discussion of results, and future directions. When assigned, students will submit a proposal/concept for their project to receive instructor feedback, and then work to complete the project. Projects will be presented and critiqued in class and project archives will be submitted for grading.-->

__*Digital Sketchbook*__ 
[TK]
<!--For this class you will maintain a cumulative digital sketchbook documenting your exercises and projects. This includes images of sketches, 3d models, textual descriptions, and photos of complete work. There will be periodic graded checks of the sketchbook (beginning, midterm, and end) of quarter for a grade.-->

__*Participation*__
Contributions to class discussions and active participation in small group work are essential to both the momentum of the course and the development of your ideas. This requires that you come to class prepared (having completed assigned reading and writing) and ready to participate in class activities. This course is based on project-based learning and you are expected to contribute as a responsible member of the community. See the participation evaluation in the Grading Scale below for more information.

## Grading Scale
A+ = 97-100 | A = 94-97 | A- = 90-94 <br>
B+ = 87-90 | B = 84-87 | B- = 80-84 <br>
C+ = 77-80 | C = 74-77 | C- = 70-74 <br>
F = below 70%<br>

Here is a description of the kind of participation in the course that would earn you an A, B, C, etc. Your instructor may use pluses and minuses to reflect your participation more fairly, but this is a general description for each letter grade.

A – Excellent<br>
Excellent participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and rigorous preparation for class work. You respond to questions and activities with enthusiasm and insight and you listen and respond thoughtfully to your peers. You submit assignments on time, adhering to posted requirements, and demonstrate a thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond creatively to any feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructor). You are an active contributor to classroom community.

B – Good<br>
Good participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and thorough preparation for class. You respond to questions with specificity and make active contributions to class. You submit assignments on time, and demonstrate a thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond effectively to the feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructor). You are a regular and reliable contributor to classroom community.

C – Satisfactory<br>
Satisfactory participation is marked by regular attendance and preparation for class. You respond to questions when prompted and participate in classroom activities, though you may sometimes be distracted. You are present in class, with few absences, and have done some of the work some of the time. You submit assignments and make some efforts toward revision proposals and final submission. You are involved in classroom activities, but you offer minimal feedback and you may not always contribute fully to classroom community.

F—Failing<br>
Failing participation is marked by excessive absences, a habitual lack of preparation, and failure to engage in classroom activities and development processes.

# Policies

Course-specific policies and rules.

| [Attendance](#attendance) |	[Late Work](#late-work)	| [Academic Integrity](#academic-integrity) | [Other People’s Code](#other-peoples-code) | [UCSD Course Policies and Resources](#ucsd-course-policies-and-resources) |

## Attendance
On-time attendance is required as well as work inside and outside of section. Please notify your instructor in advance if you must be absent for illness or family emergency. Any absences must be cleared with the instructor, or justified with written documentation (e.g. letter from team, etc.). We do not differentiate between mental and physical health and in either case please be in communication for when you need to take a day off. After a student misses a week’s worth of classes each subsequent missed class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-) Excessive tardiness or leaving early will also impact your grade and will follow the same rubric.

## Late Work
An assignment may receive an F if a student does not participate in every phase of the development of the project and meet all deadlines for preliminary materials (proposals, drafts, work in progress, etc.). Failure to submit any of the graded course assignments is grounds for failure in the course. If an exercise or project, plus required addenda, is not submitted in class on the date due, it will be considered late and will lose one 5% for each day or part of a day past due. Assignments are due in class and via online submission, as specified in assignment descriptions. Any late submissions must be approved by your faculty instructor well in advance of the due date.

## Academic Integrity 
Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.

### Other People's Code

We will use many open source resources to make our work. It is ok to use others’ code, or their 3d models. However, **you need to cite your sources**, and **you need to do transformative work/make it your own**.

## Students with Disabilities

Students registered with the Office for Students with Disabilities are to provide copies of their AFA letters to both the course instructor and the OSD Liaison of the Visual Arts Department . If you have any questions about utilizing your OSD accommodation, please contact Dept. OSD Liaison at [vis-ug@ucsd.edu](mailto:vis-ug@ucsd.edu) or 858-534-2860. You may also contact the Office of Students with Disabilities directly at [osd@ucsd.edu](mailto:osd@ucsd.edu) or 858-534-4382. [http://disabilities.ucsd.edu/](http://disabilities.ucsd.edu/)

## UCSD Course Policies and Resources

Students are responsible for knowing the university academic policies and resources found on [this page](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/academic-regulations.html):
- Adding and dropping courses
- Exams
- Grades and grade points

# Land Acknowledgment

This public acknowledgment serves to honor and respect Indigenous peoples and their land on which our campus resides. UC San Diego was built upon the territory of the Kumeyaay Nation. From time immemorial, the Kumeyaay people have been a part of this land. Today, the Kumeyaay people continue to maintain their political sovereignty and cultural traditions as vital members of the San Diego community.
